2.0.5 Release Notes

Thanks to everyone who downloaded and tried SPAW Editor v.2! 
Your feedback was extremely helpful.

2.0.5 is mainly a wide release of version 2.0.5 beta which introduced support
for Safari browser on Mac (and Windows). There's only one additional bug fix
so, if you were already using 2.0.5 beta and you don't work with any RTL 
languages like Hebrew or Arabic, there's no real need to upgrade.

For a complete list of changes see changelog.txt 

---
This release includes some language files that were ported from version 1.
This means that some of the messages will appear in English instead of the
language of a specific language file. In case you are fluent in any language
that wasn't updated for version 2, we would really appreciate if you could invest
a little of your time to bring these files up to date.

We will post all the updates in our blog at http://blog.solmetra.com
